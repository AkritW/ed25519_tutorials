# ed25519_tutorials
Elliptic curve cryptography (ed25519) beginner tutorials in Python 3
#### Instructions
Just download the repo and read the tutorial files!
#### Notes
* These tutorials are made with Monero (XMR) cryptocurrency in mind (but not too much). However, the ubiquity of elliptic curve cryptography means that these tutorials must also be applicable to other cryptocurrencies.
* These tutorials only cover working with elliptic curve cryptography *in general*. Things specific to ed25519 like elliptic curve description, cofactor consideration, etc. are not included.
